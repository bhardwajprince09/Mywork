<h1>Once upon a time in F.R.I.E.N.D.S.....</h1>
<p>Here comes another sunny day...
Phoebe,Ross,Rachel,Chandlier and Monica are sitting n having drinks at Central Park.Joe was out on a date with a random chick.This girl is considered to be a jackpot
not because of her looks but because of her magical hand.
Not because she actually have magical hand but she wore something magical in her hands.So Joe was all set to meet this girl because if he got that magical thing he
could ask for anything in life.
Here comes a girl with a figure zero....Ohhh...i mean to say one followed with two zeros...really a fat chick which Joe had also expected but he still proceeds in
gentle way n asked her to order what she wants.
The girl ordered a Cranberry juice...Yeahh she ordered that but after two hamburgers,pizza,sandwiches n lot more shit..Joe had discovered that bracelet in her hand but 
he was wondering how he could get that out of her hand..
This girl was suffering from a problem that she get turned on easily if some guy try to approach her...Joe being unaware of that tried to hold her hand in order to get that magical thing
but its not that easy..Suddenly the girl started taking off her clothes and Joe was unable to catch her signs..so he command the waiter to turn on Ac ...but suddenly the girl hopped over 
Joe n took him on the terrace of cafe..After 6 hrs of long struggle(u know what i mean)Joe was able to get that bracelet from her..He ran quickly outside the cafe
and reached Central park...
Everyone laughed ...Chandelier marked a comment "Joe how can u be so sexy bitch!!"
Ross shouted u worked a lot on ur chest!!Oh actually breast!!
lol!!!!!!!!!!!!
then Joe noticed himself in lingeries of that girl...He ran to catch his jeans n then settled down at Central Park.
Joe explained whole story to his friends n how he succeded in getting that bracelet..
Now everyone wanted to fulfill their wishes with the help of bracelet..
So turn by turn,all of them revealed their wishes..
First was Phoebe who wanted to have her own beauty parlour in the middle of city..Ross wanted his wife back...Rachel wanted Ross in her life... Chandler
wished to have escort service open at his name..Monica wished to have a boyfriend...Lastly Joe wanted to have a decent job where he would be respected and bunch of 
chicks at his service...
Days or even months passed but their wishes remain unfullfilled...So they all started doubting the authenticity of this bracelet..
Suddenly an old man wearing ZARA suit stepped out from his hummerh and entered the Central park..All of them started staring him and the way he ordered the drinks at the bar..
Joe said he wanted that lifestyle whereas Monica wished to have that kind of man in her life..
Suddenly man approached them and said "Here's that fucking awesome bracelet which made my life"..Everyone started wondering how that old man and bracelet are related.
Monica offered that old man a drink and Rachel requested him to tell the story about bracelet...
An old man started telling his story how he used to be a poor guy when he dont even get two times proper meal but this bracelet had changed his life...
Phoebe yelled but HOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW???
He proceed with his story and told them that his days changed when he met a girl with the magical hand..(same girl joe met)..Both of them had a great time and she told 
him that this bracelet can change your life...
But the condition is that "THIS BRACELET SHOULD BE OPERATED BY HER FIRST"...
All of them ran fast outside the Central park in order to get their wishes fulfilled by the women.
Now the race started to find that lady who can change their life....With the mutual decision they decided that among them who find that lady first will get their wish fulfilled..
1...2...3...
Joe,Monica,Chandler took right whereas Ross,Rachel and Phoebe took left ....As they proceed all were separated out and hence everyone wanted to chase that lady.
Finally after long hours of struggle Joe found that chick but her face was full of anger because of what Joe did to her last time...
Joe ,the brave man,still went to talk to the lady but she didnt respond...She slapped Joe hard and took that bracelet from him..Suddenly she made a wish out of that bracelet which was not expected by Joe..
She called out the names of the Avengers,Joe was still in confusion what was happening ??He asked her what r u doing my lady??but she ignored her..
After some time all the friends reached out there in order to help Joe which they realised later on...
Actually that were the names of superheroes and they suddenly appeared in the scene..
Chandler shouted "Yippie...Avengers part 3 shooting started"!!!
Phoebe yelled "Hey can i take a selfie with u guys?"
Suddenly iron man kissed Rachel and Ross(who was actually frightened) said "You r not allowed to kiss anyone even if u r a movie star"..
Monica pointing towards THOR marked a comment "Now i am finally thinking of having kids"...
Lady shouted"SHUT YOUR MOUTHS....They are not here to fulfill ur wishes or to flirt with u ...They r here to kill U all for what Joe did to me in the last meeting.."
Joe said"But they r my friends...They can even die for me..So can u leave me ?"
Everyone wondered wtf Joe was talking about and started arguing with him...<br><br>
